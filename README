DESCRIPTION

    This module is a wrapper around CA-SCM (formerly known as Harvest)
    commands. It provides a perl-ish interface to setting the context in
    which each command is executed, along with optional loading of context
    from files as well as parsing output logs.

CONTEXT

    The context is a *hash of hashes* which contain the following types of
    keys:

    global
        This specifies the global context. Any context set here will be
        applied to every command that uses it.

                my $global_context = {
                                       global => { b  => 'harvest',
                                                   eh => 'user.dfo',
                                       },
                  };

    command specific
        This provides a command specific context. Context set here will be
        applied only to those specific commands.

                my $hco_context = {
                                    hco => { up => 1,
                                             vp => '\repository\myapp\src',
                                             pn => 'Checkout Items',
                                    },
                };

    The global and command context keys are synonymous with the command line
    options detailed in the CA-SCM Reference Manual. Options that do not
    require a value should be set to '1'. i.e. "{hco => {up => 1} }" is
    equivalent to "hco -up". The methods are intelligent enough to apply
    only the context keys that are used by a command. For e.g. a global
    context of "vp" will not apply to "hcp".

    The 'common' options *i* and *di* are not applicable and ignored for all
    commands. See "SECURITY"

    The following methods are available to manage context

  set_context($context)

    Sets the context. Old context is forgotten. The argument provided must
    be a hash reference

  update_context($context)

    Updates the current context. The argument provided must be a hash
    reference

  load_context($file)

    This loads the context from an 'INI' file. The root parameters defines
    the global context. Each sectional parameter defines the command
    specific context. Old context is forgotten.

            # Load context file at initialization. This will croak if it fails to read the context file
            my $cascm = CASCM::Wrapper->new( { context_file => $file } );

            # Alternatively
            $cascm->load_context($file) or die $cascm->errstr;

    This is a sample context file

            # Sample context file

            # Root parameters. These define the 'global' context
            b  = harvest
            eh = user.dfo

            # Sectional parameters. These define the 'command' context

            [hco]
                    up = 1
                    vp = \repository\myapp\src

            [hcp]
                    st = development

    NOTE: This method requires Config::Tiny in order to read the context
    file.

  get_context()

    Returns a hash reference of current context

            my $context = $cascm->get_context();
            use Data::Dumper;
            print Dumper($context);

CA-SCM METHODS

    Almost every 'h' command that uses a context is supported. The command
    names are synonymous with the methods used to invoke them.

    Every method accepts two optional arguments. The first is an hash
    reference that overrides/appends to the context for that method. This
    allows setting a context only for that specific method call. The second
    is an array of arguments that is passed on to the 'h' command. Any
    arguments provided is passed using the '-arg' option.

            # No parameters. Everything required is already set in the context
            $cascm->hdlp() or die $cascm->errstr;

            # Array of arguments
            $cascm->hci( @files ) or die $cascm->errstr;

            # Override/Append to context
            $cascm->hci( { p => 'new_package' }, @files ) or die $cascm->errstr;

    The methods can be called in a 'dry run' mode. Where the method returns
    the full command line, without executing anything. This can be useful
    for debugging.

            $cascm = CASCM::Wrapper->new( { dry_run => 1 } );
            $cascm->set_context($context);
            $cmd = $cascm->hsync();
            print "Calling hsync() would have executed -> $cmd";

SECURITY

    This module uses the *di* option for executing CA-SCM commands. This
    prevents any passwords from being exposed while the command is running.
    The temporary *di* file is deleted irrespective if the outcome of the
    command.

LOGGING

    Since CA-SCM commands output only to log files, this module allows
    parsing and logging of a command's output. Log::Any is required to use
    this feature, which in turn allows you to use any (supproted) Logging
    mechanism. When using this, any 'o' or 'oa' options specified in the
    context will be ignored. Your scripts will need to use the appropriate
    Log::Any::Adapter to capture the log statements. The CA-SCM log is
    parsed and the messages are logged either as 'INFO', 'WARN' or 'ERROR'.

            # Using Log4perl

            use CASCM::Wrapper;
            use Log::Log4perl;
            use Log::Any::Adapter;

            Log::Log4perl->init('log4perl.conf');
            Log::Any::Adapter->set('Log4perl');

            # Get logger
            my $log = Log::Log4perl->get_logger();

            # Set parse_logs to true. This will croak if Log:Any is not found.
            my $cascm = CASCM::Wrapper->new( { parse_logs => 1 } );

            # Set Context
            my $context = { ... };
            $cascm->set_context($context);

            # Calling the method automatically will parse the log output into the Log4perl object
            # The output is also logged in the 'CASCM::Wrapper' category.

            $cascm->hco(@files) or die $cascm->errstr;

ERROR HANDLING

    All methods return true on success and "undef" on failure. The error
    that most likely caused the *last* failure can be obtained by calling
    the "errstr" method.

DEPENDENCIES

    CA-SCM r12 client. Harvest 7.1 might work, but has not been tested.

    The CA-SCM methods depends on the corresponding commands to be available
    in the *PATH*

    At least Perl 5.6.1 is required to run.

    Optionally, Config::Tiny is required to read context files

    Optionally, Log::Any and Log::Any::Adapter is required to parse CA-SCM
    log files
